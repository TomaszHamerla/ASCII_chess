The program includes the movement rules for all chess pieces. Additionally, it takes into account the following aspects:

1. Checkmate (mate): The condition where the opponent's king is in a position to be captured ('check') and there is no legal move to escape capture ('mate').

2. Check: The condition where a king is under direct attack and there is a need to respond to the threat.

3. Stalemate (draw): The situation in which the player whose turn it is to move has no legal moves and their king is not in check.

4. Castling (kingside and queenside): A special move involving the king and a rook, allowing both to move simultaneously under certain conditions.

5. En passant (capturing in passing): A pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn, capturing it as if the pawn had moved only one square forward.

The game progresses with moves being recorded in algebraic notation, and the entire game can be saved to a file using standard chess notation.
